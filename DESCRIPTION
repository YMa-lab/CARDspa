Description: CARD is a reference-based deconvolution method that estimates cell 
    type composition in spatial transcriptomics based on cell type specific expression 
    information obtained from a reference scRNA-seq data. A key feature of CARD is 
    its ability to accommodate spatial correlation in the cell type composition 
    across tissue locations, enabling accurate and spatially informed cell type 
    deconvolution as well as refined spatial map construction. CARD relies on an 
    efficient optimization algorithm for constrained maximum likelihood estimation 
    and is scalable to spatial transcriptomics with tens of thousands of spatial 
    locations and tens of thousands of genes.
