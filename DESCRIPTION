Description: CARD is a reference-based deconvolution method that estimates cell 
    type composition in spatial transcriptomics based on cell type specific 
    expression information obtained from a reference scRNA-seq data. A key 
    feature of CARD is its ability to accommodate spatial correlation in the 
    cell type composition across tissue locations, enabling accurate and 
    spatially informed cell type deconvolution as well as refined spatial map 
    construction. CARD relies on an efficient optimization algorithm for 
    constrained maximum likelihood estimation and is scalable to spatial 
    transcriptomics with tens of thousands of spatial locations and tens of 
    thousands of genes.
