\usage{
createCARDObject(
  sc_count,
  sc_meta,
  spatial_count,
  spatial_location,
  ct.varname,
  ct.select,
  sample.varname,
  minCountGene = 100,

)
}
\arguments{
\item{sc_count}{Raw scRNA-seq count data, each column is a cell and each row
is a gene.}

\item{sc_meta}{data frame, with each row representing the cell type and/or
sample information of a specific cell. The row names of this data frame
should match exactly with the column names of the sc_count data}

\item{spatial_count}{Raw spatial resolved transcriptomics data, each column
is a spatial location, and each row is a gene.}

\item{spatial_location}{data frame, with two columns representing the x and
y coordinates of the spatial location. The rownames of this data frame
should match eaxctly with the columns of the spatial_count.}

\item{ct.varname}{character, the name of the column in metaData that
specifies the cell type annotation information}

\item{ct.select}{vector of cell type names that you are interested in to
deconvolute, default as NULL. If NULL, then use all cell types provided by
single cell dataset;}

\item{sample.varname}{character,the name of the column in metaData that
specifies the sample information. If NULL, we just use the whole as one
sample.}

\item{minCountGene}{Minimum counts for each gene}

\item{minCountSpot}{Minimum counts for each spatial location}
}
\value{
Returns CARD object with filtered spatial count and single cell
RNA-seq dataset.
